# Basil-Bot-Discord
A discord bot test that I made a while ago.

This discord bot focues on the use of discord.js and was tested on the heroku platform.

Modules not included.

2018:

FEB 1 UPDATE:
Due to large issues with the intial design of bot, it is undergoing a rework. The old bot can be found in BasilOLD.

FEB 15 UPDATE:
As of now, Basil has a simple filtering system and a simple play feature. Queueing still needs work as skipping causes the .end() to run twice.

MAR 12 UPDATE:
Basil can now somewhat Queue and Skip due to the delay added. Filtering System updated. As Basil is being tested on two servers. Music Playlist will need to be tested. Basil will most likely be unable to support two servers playing music due to the way it is coded. Will work on it in a future update.

APR 5 UPDATE:
Partial implementation of PostGreSQL DB for distinguishing servers. Fixing the Tables/Queries is needed. GName query needs to change to GID queries. (Will cause collisions if GNames are the same. Music Queue needs to be transferred over to the DB based instead of memory based.
