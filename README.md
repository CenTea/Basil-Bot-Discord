# Basil-Bot-Discord
A discord bot test that I made a while ago.

This discord bot focues on the use of discord.js and was tested on the heroku platform.

Modules not included.

2018:

FEB 1 UPDATE:
Due to large issues with the intial design of bot, it is undergoing a rework. The old bot can be found in BasilOLD.

FEB 15 UPDATE:
As of now, Basil has a simple filtering system and a simple play feature. Queueing still needs work as skipping causes the .end() to run twice.
